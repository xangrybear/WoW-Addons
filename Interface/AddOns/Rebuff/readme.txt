Rebuff
- Purpose: Check for missing buffs
- Author: Moxie <Always East> - Classic WoW Beta PvP - Live realm TBD - Discord Neko/Moxey#2051


Usage:
- Right-click icon to configure (use minimap icon if main icon is hidden)
- Left-click icon to broadcast missing buffs, if enabled
- Mouseover icon to display missing buffs

Options:
- Set up class-specific buff monitoring
- Set custom buff names (if you like "Fort" instead of "Power Word: Fortitude")
- Monitor only specific groups (for those assigned to buff only specific groups)
- Separate buffs for tanks, for things like Blessing of Salvation

TODO / Issues:
- Needs more testing!
- Only tracks max level buffs
